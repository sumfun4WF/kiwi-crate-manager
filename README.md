# Automatic Crate Manager
Python script that automatically opens new crates for you and avoids you missclicking on wrong buttons that make you spend BattlePoints for no reason (which is the main reason this script was designed for).

It was originally created by [seanwlk](https://github.com/seanwlk/), however, it looks like he dopped the public support after K.I.W.I., so I updated API URL and added steam support.

# Requisites
- Python
- Python `requests` module
- Python `json` module
- Python `signal` module
- Python `getpass` module
- 3 minutes to config
- Brain

# How
I will not explain how to install python and how to configure the enviroment. There isn't much to say about the script, just run, login and leave it running.
